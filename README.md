# colony_processing
This notebook provides code to process timelapse imaging data of growing stem cell colonies expressing ERK-KTR(kinase translocation sensors) sensors, as well as an H2B marker for cell nuclei. The notebook uses stardist for segmentation, a CNN for classification of cell cycle states to be used with btrack for tracking lineages.
